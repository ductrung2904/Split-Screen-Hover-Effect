                <p>Mitsuha Miyamizu (宮水 三葉 Miyamizu Mitsuha?) is the female protagonist of Kimi no Na wa.. She is a
                    17-year old high-school student living in a small rural town called Itomori, and a member of the
                    Miyamizu family, where she serves as a priestess in her family shrine. However, Mitsuha feels
                    dissatisfied with her small-town life and due to the strained relationship she has with her stern
                    father and the criticism she gets when performing as a shrine maiden, she wishes to live as a
                    handsome boy in Tokyo. Her wish was eventually partially granted as she would start switching bodies
                    with a high-school student named Taki Tachibana in her dreams.</p>
